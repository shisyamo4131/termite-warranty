# Common Project Governance Contract

This contract contains mandatory governance shared by every project created or migrated with `scaffold-project-governance`. A project may add stricter or more specific rules, but must not weaken, replace, or silently contradict this contract.

## Instruction Ownership

- Treat this file and the generated root `AGENTS.md` as managed artifacts. Do not edit them in the project.
- Put project-specific instructions in `governance/project-rules.md` and project facts in the task-routed authoritative documents.
- Apply managed artifacts with the approved project sync; the renderer is a read-only alignment check.
- Reject direct changes to managed artifacts, stale hashes, an oversized generated `AGENTS.md`, or a project rule that weakens this contract.
- Keep the common contract concise. Route detailed product, environment, command, data, and operational guidance through project-owned documents.

## Non-negotiable Coordinator Gate

Before any file write, delegation, Git mutation, external write, implementation, or completion claim, the coordinator must:

1. Read the active `AGENTS.md`, `governance/project-rules.md`, and the smallest task-routed authoritative document set.
2. Identify the current phase, confirmed scope, source of truth, unresolved decisions, and existing behavior that may already satisfy the request.
3. State or internally verify the allowed files, forbidden scope, approval boundaries, required validation, fallback or rollback, and completion contract.
4. Separate confirmed facts, reasonable but unconfirmed assumptions, open decisions, and repository conflicts.

If any required item is missing, stale, contradictory, or unauthorized, remain read-only and obtain direction. Do not bypass this gate because a change appears small, beneficial, obvious, or reversible.


## Migration Work

- Resolve blockers applicable to the requested scope and use the normal project verification policy.
- Use independent review where the impact warrants it and keep concurrent write ownership disjoint.
- Keep current facts, remaining work and measured verification in existing project documents. Git holds prior text and sensibly grouped changes.
- Later substantive edits require affected review and verification again before completion.

## Source of Truth and Reading

- Keep one current confirmed specification. Use Git for previous text, ADRs for decision rationale, roadmaps for evidence-backed progress, and the changelog for concise visible changes.
- Use the project documentation map to select the smallest sufficient reading set. Do not require every task to load every document.
- Keep important documents reachable from a root or product/domain index. Update indexes and inbound links in the same change when a document is added, renamed, moved, or retired.
- Do not use chat history as the sole source of requirements, decisions, progress, operations, ownership, or restart state.
- Distinguish implemented, planned, proposed, unavailable, and historical behavior.

## Evidence-bound Critical Identifiers

- Treat identifiers that can change scope, compatibility, or external effects as unconfirmed until they are obtained in the current turn from a task-routed authoritative source or the actual target. This includes package names, versions, digests or integrity values, repository paths, branches, commits, tags, environment, project, or database IDs, deploy targets, and data targets. Read-only discovery may investigate an explicitly unconfirmed value, but must not present or use it as confirmed.
- Treat chat history, compaction summaries, memory, model inference, parent or coordinator prompts, and subagent reports as leads only. None of them can establish a critical identifier by itself, and repeated agreement between agents does not promote a claim to confirmed fact.
- Before writing a critical identifier into a delegation prompt as confirmed, the coordinator must personally verify the exact source, location or command, and value. A delegated agent must independently compare prompt identifiers with the actual target or authoritative source before any file write, Git mutation, test, install, network call, or other state change.
- Stop and report an identifier that is missing, stale, ambiguous, or inconsistent. Do not create owned application diffs while a material metadata conflict remains unresolved.
- For published-artifact adoption, verify the applicable chain: source or tag manifest, recorded release evidence or registry metadata, and consumer manifest or lock data including name, version, resolved location, and integrity. When network access is unapproved, do not infer remote state; verify recorded evidence and local source only and leave the remote gate explicitly unverified.
- A project may add a stricter deterministic preflight in project-owned rules, scripts, or runbooks, but may not weaken this gate.

## Session Capacity Routing

- Treat `容量チェック`, `タスク容量確認`, `セッション容量確認`, and `session size / handoff threshold確認` as requests to measure the persisted Codex task/session file for the current task, not model token usage or context-window capacity.
- Route the request through the project documentation map to a project-owned coordination/session-lifecycle procedure and project-local measurement command. Require the current task ID and exactly one matching session; never infer the newest or most recently modified session when parallel tasks may exist.
- Report the identified task, session file, measured size, approved handoff threshold (300 MiB by default), usage percentage, handoff state, Codex-wide reference capacity and default 10 GiB warning threshold, scan completeness/errors, measurement time/source, command result, and independently observed exit status without exposing session contents or sensitive data.
- Propose handoff only when the identified session reaches the approved per-session threshold. If the task ID is unknown, resolution yields zero or multiple sessions, the command fails, or the total scan is incomplete, report the condition and stop the affected decision instead of guessing.

## Approval and Specification Changes

- Do not convert brainstorming, questions, comparisons, research, or assumptions into confirmed requirements.
- Treat explicit adoption or change instructions as approval only for the stated scope.
- Before a material change, present the current rule, proposed rule, reason, impact, compatibility, migration, rollback, and required tests.
- After approval, update only the specification, roadmaps, ADRs and index, changelog, implementation, tests, operations, data-contract documents, and user documentation that are actually affected. Do not create unrelated version changes, zero-progress history, or evidence-only churn.
- If the full update cannot be completed, list every unreflected surface and do not claim completion.
- Ask at most three confirmation or approval questions per round. State why each answer is needed and what changes with the answer.

## Multi-agent Coordination

- Keep the user-facing primary task as coordinator. Do not create a separate coordinator subagent.
- Use only roles whose results are needed. Keep application-code writes concentrated in the developer; allow the tester to edit tests only when explicitly delegated; keep explorer, researcher, reviewer, security review, and release review read-only unless a project contract explicitly requires otherwise.
- Prefer parallel work only for independent scopes. Never allow overlapping parallel writes without explicit disjoint ownership.
- Give every delegated checkpoint its ID, common baseline, owned and forbidden files, source of truth, completion contract, validation, approval boundary, and callback destination.
- A delegated task normally stops after editing and validation, then reports exact files, diff, tests, unverified items, approval boundaries, and worktree state. The coordinator reviews and commits accepted files.
- Never treat unintegrated work as a confirmed dependency. Prioritize review and integration over launching another write cycle.
- Wait for all requested evidence before consolidating or claiming completion.

## Event-driven Checkpoints

- For ongoing coordination, issue one reviewable checkpoint at a time and wait for one completion, failure, specification-question, or approval-boundary callback before issuing the next.
- Establish the user-defined work-session ending condition before ongoing assignments.
- After ordinary delegated-task creation or application restart, verify the route with a no-change callback before real work. Task replacement uses ordinary repository startup.
- A callback must identify the checkpoint and terminal state, exact files, diff, tests, unverified items, approval boundaries, and worktree state. After notification, the task waits.
- If callback delivery fails, do not retry repeatedly. Preserve the complete report in the delegated task and stop for recovery.
- Use scheduled polling only when callbacks are unavailable or the user explicitly selects it. Keep unchanged polls silent and delta-only; cadence is not a task deadline.

## Git and Worktree Integrity

- Use the repository in the primary working directory configured by the user for every project task. Do not create, select, or assign a task-specific linked worktree or alternate repository copy by default.
- Before using a separate worktree, explain why the primary working directory is insufficient and obtain explicit user approval. State the proposed path, branch, owner, integration method, lifetime, and cleanup plan. If an unapproved separate worktree is discovered, stop state-changing work there, preserve it, and ask the user for direction; do not delete it automatically.
- Preserve unrelated user changes. Do not discard, overwrite, stage, or commit files outside the accepted owned scope.
- Prefer coordinator-owned Git integration. Stage only reviewed files and reuse an existing reviewed delegated-task commit instead of duplicating it.
- Do not push, deploy, delete material data, rewrite history, or perform other external or destructive actions without separate authorization.

## User-requested Task Replacement

On a user replacement request: (1) update existing authoritative project facts and next work, commit relevant changes in sensible groups and leave the primary repository clean; (2) create a fresh non-fork task in that primary project with the same base name and next sequence number from the current task or user instruction. Do not create per-edit/task-action commits or an empty replacement commit.

Every task reads `AGENTS.md`, `governance/project-rules.md` and routed repository authorities before project work. Manual creation and recovery after the old task becomes unavailable use the same startup, without an old task ID or old-owner cooperation.

No replacement state/history/cache, handshake, or dedicated validator is required. Governance changes do not force rotation. Ordinary project work follows repository instructions without loading the installed scaffold skill.

## Roadmaps and Progress

- Use roadmaps for ongoing, multi-phase, multi-product, or autonomously coordinated work. Keep them separate from confirmed requirements.
- Base progress on verified deliverables or completed gates, not elapsed time or unverified self-report.
- Weighted milestones must total 100 and state whether partial credit is allowed. Do not average materially different products without approved program weighting.
- If scope growth or corrected completion judgment lowers progress, record the old value, new value, and reason.
- Link milestones to principal design, implementation, test, review, deployment, or acceptance evidence.

## Verification Selection and Staging

- Before implementation, classify the change by every applicable class and impact surface. The minimum classes are documentation-only; UI, CSS, or layout; application logic; data contract, schema, or migration; governance, permissions, or agent configuration; and build, release, or deploy. Mixed changes use the union of required gates. Unknown or unbounded impact fails safe to the project's comprehensive suite.
- Route the classification through project-owned `governance/verification-policy.json` and an aligned matrix in operations or testing documentation. The JSON is the machine-readable source; it must designate the comprehensive gate IDs, and the managed sync must refresh a generated policy summary that the validator compares exactly with the JSON. For each class, define path or surface triggers, fast iteration checks, targeted regression, completion gates, release-only gates, included gate IDs, invalidation triggers, omittable gates, and where omission reasons are recorded. Do not assume that type checking, lint, build, or any named test tier is fast or universally required; the project defines its measured commands.
- During iteration, prefer the smallest fast static checks and directly affected tests. After they pass, run impact-area regression. Before completion, run the selected completion-gate set once against the final applicable worktree state. Run release-only gates only for release, publication, installation, migration execution, or deployment decisions that require them.
- Preserve comprehensive validation for project scaffolding, governance migration, managed-governance synchronization, common-contract changes, permission or agent-policy changes, and release/deploy operations. This exception does not make the same full suite mandatory for unrelated daily application work.
- If gate A includes gate B and A preserves B's named result, output, and exit status through a verified fail-fast or aggregate runner, selecting A satisfies B; do not also invoke B as an unconditional separate gate. Declare inclusion by stable gate ID, reject unknown IDs or cycles, and show the relationship in project operations.
- After a failure or later edit, rerun first the failed gates and any prior evidence invalidated by the changed files, configuration, dependencies, generated artifacts, or environment. Successful evidence may be reused only when the project matrix establishes that the later change did not invalidate it. A final completion decision must contain every gate selected for the final impact set.
- Record omitted gates and the matrix-based reason in the task callback, completion report, or durable release evidence selected by the project. Omission is never allowed merely to avoid a known failure.

## Material Change and Documentation Scope

- A material change alters a confirmed requirement or acceptance criterion, user-visible or external behavior, API or data compatibility, durable architecture or safety decision, operational or rollback procedure, approval boundary, roadmap scope, completion criterion, or earned progress. A bug fix that restores already-confirmed behavior is not automatically a specification change.
- Update the specification only when confirmed requirements or acceptance criteria change; update a data contract only when data shape, meaning, lifecycle, compatibility, schema, or migration changes. Specification and data-contract versions are independent unless the project explicitly couples them.
- Create or supersede an ADR only for a durable decision or change to one, not as a log for routine implementation adjustments. Update roadmap scope, completion criteria, evidence, or progress only when they actually change; do not require a progress-history entry solely to record `+0` for a minor fix.
- Update operations, changelog, indexes, design, acceptance, and user documentation only when their governed behavior, evidence, or navigation is affected. A UI or CSS adjustment does not by itself require data-model, data-contract, migration, governance, ADR, or roadmap changes.

## Verification Evidence Integrity

- Record passing counts, success statements, acceptance results, and completion evidence only after the corresponding command has actually completed with exit status 0. Before that point label the gate planned, running, failed, blocked, or not run as applicable.
- Run every required validator, test, build, lint, migration check, or other completion gate so that its result and exit status are independently observable.
- When combining required checks, use only a verified fail-fast wrapper that exits nonzero on the first failure or a verified aggregate runner that records every result and exits nonzero if any check fails.
- Do not use command chaining such as `;` as completion evidence when a later successful command can replace an earlier failure in the overall process exit status.
- Record each required check's command, result, and exit status separately in callbacks, completion reports, handoffs, commit or integration evidence, and release decisions.
- Diagnostic command batches may use other grouping for investigation, but must be labeled diagnostic and must not be reused as completion evidence or a success decision.
- Bind completion evidence to the applicable revision or worktree state and selected impact set. If a later change matches a gate's invalidation trigger, mark that evidence stale until the gate is rerun successfully.

## Safety and Sensitive Information

- Never place secrets, credentials, session data, private production records, or unredacted confidential samples in repository documents, prompts, tests, logs, or generated artifacts.
- Do not invent commands, environments, test results, implementation status, compliance claims, external-service behavior, business facts, or operational capabilities.
- Keep network access and external writes disabled unless separately approved. Apply least privilege to project roles and tools.
- Mark unimplemented, unavailable, unverified, and planned behavior clearly.
- Keep project-specific sensitive-data rules and external-effect boundaries in `governance/project-rules.md` and the authoritative specification/operations documents.

## Completion Gate

Before completion, verify and report:

- changed behavior and exact changed files;
- owned diff and worktree state;
- alignment of only the affected specification, roadmap, ADR, changelog, operations, data-contract, user-documentation, and index surfaces, plus recorded reasons for intentionally unaffected surfaces when the project requires them;
- each required validation and test command, its result, and its independently determined exit status;
- unverified items, residual risks, unresolved decisions, and pending approvals;
- governance/configuration changes;
- the user's next action.

Do not claim completion while required work, validation, integration, documentation, or approval remains outstanding.

## Project-specific Rules

Before any write, delegation, Git mutation, external action, implementation, or completion claim, read `governance/project-rules.md` and the task-routed authoritative documents it identifies. Project-specific rules may be stricter than the common contract but must not weaken or contradict it.
